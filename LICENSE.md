## Freeware LICENCE only for v0.1996 -- before 1997:

**"Freeware" is software you do not pay for, ever, in any way.**

- It is not "Shareware," which you eventually must pay for.

- It is not "Nagware," which tries to get you to pay for something that was
  originally offered as though it was free.

- It is not "Crippleware," software that perpetually tries to annoy and tease
  you about features only enabled in the commercial version.

- It is not "Adware," an increasingly popular form of software that is
  actually a vehicle for advertising, and that is much like the modern
  Internet itself.

- It is not "Spyware," a sleazy kind of program that opens a channel of
  communication between your computer and someone who wants to know what you
  are doing.

Given the list of exclusions above, almost no modern software is truly
freeware. Real freeware must never self-cripple, expire, nag, cajole,
advertise, or confront the user with any content not related to the function
of the program.

When you download a freeware program, you have some rights, some
responsibilities, and you have just one remedy:

### Rights

- That you will not have to pay for the program, in any way, ever.
- That the program will turn out to be what its description says it is.
- That the program will meet at least some of your needs.
- That your privacy will not be invaded.

### Responsibilities

- You must read the documentation and FAQ list before asking a question.
- You may not demand new answers to questions already covered in the documentation.
- You may not demand customer service or one-on-one instruction.
- You don't have the right to demand program changes to suit your personal tastes.

### Remedies

- There's just one â€” you can stop using the program. You cannot complain about
  it as though you paid for it, because you didn't.

Users of freeware must not forget that they didn't pay for the software, and
therefore they cannot demand the satisfaction of an imaginary contract between
the programmer and themselves.

## Who is Paul Lutus who wrote the Freeware license?

Paul Lutus designed spacecraft components for the NASA Space Shuttle and
created a mathematical model of the solar system used by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory during the Viking Mars mission. Then, at the beginning of the
personal computer revolution, Lutus switched career paths and took up computer
science. His best-known program is "Apple Writer," an internationally
successful word processing program for the early Apple computers.

In 1983 Reed College awarded Lutus the Vollum Award for Distinguished
Accomplishment in Science and Technology, Oregon's most prestigious academic
honor. Other recipients of this award include Nobel Prizewinner Linus Pauling,
Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Linus Torvalds.
